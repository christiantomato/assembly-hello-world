Arm Architecture:

- 64 bit registers, 31 total registers. 
- x0-x30 accessess the 64 bit registers
- w0-w30 used to access only 32 bits of the larger 64 bit registers

Assembly Instructions:

- <operator> <destination>, <source>
- <operator> <destination>, <immediate>
- <operator> <destiantion>, [address]

ex. mov x0, #4
(moves the 'immediate' 4, into the first 64 bit register)

System Call:

To do anything, we need to request a service from the kernel, which we can do with system calls

- svc 0 is the command for the system calls
- upon this action, the kernel stores the system call number in register x16
- registers x0-x4 determine how to do it and serve as arguements for the system call
